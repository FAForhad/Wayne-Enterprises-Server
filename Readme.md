## Works

For loaded data in client site we have to use server side

- I used express for integration easily with database and client site.
- I used cors For get the data's form any type of operating system.
- I used mongodb for store the data's . With the commend of cline site i used CURD operation to integreation with database.
- I used dotenv for use and hide the importent data of mongodb and jwt.
- I used json web token(jwt) for secure the data's form external commends.
